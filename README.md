🌱 AgroBot – Intelligent Plant Disease Detection System (AI + CNN + NLP)

A smart agricultural assistant that detects plant diseases from images using Deep Learning (CNN) and answers user queries using an NLP-powered chatbot.

🚀 Overview

AgroBot is a complete AI system built using:

🧠 CNN Model (TensorFlow/Keras) for image-based disease detection

💬 NLP Engine for symptom-based text queries

🌐 Flask Web App for user interaction

🖼️ Image Upload to analyze plant leaves

📄 MIT Licensed for open-source usage

This project helps farmers and students quickly identify plant diseases and receive treatment recommendations.

🖼️ Demo Workflow

1️⃣ Upload an image of a plant leaf
2️⃣ CNN model predicts the disease
3️⃣ NLP system handles text-based queries like:
“My potato has brown spots”
4️⃣ Web UI displays:
✔ Detected disease
✔ Causes
✔ Symptoms
✔ Treatment
✔ Prevention
✔ Possible alternative diseases
